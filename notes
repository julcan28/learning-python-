#notes 

-examples-

*hello world*
print("Hello World") //prints or display what is written inside to the console

*shape drawing*  
    -triangle

print("      /|")
print("     / |")
print("    /  |")
print("   /   |")
print("  /____|")    //order of the instruction matters

-variables & data types-
//variables are like containers 
*variable types*
character_name = "Tom"    # string (plain text)
character_age = 50.5      # number (float)
is_male = True            # boolean


*changeable variable example*
character_name = "John"
character_age = 45
print("The name of the man is " + character_name + ",")
print("he is " + str(character_age) + " years old.") //numbers or float must be converted to string using str()
character_name = "Mike" //if you want to change the variable in between the text
print("He liked the name" + character_name + ",")
print("but doesn't want to change the name given by his parents.")

-string-
print("Hello\nWorld") // \n to insert new line to the string
print("\"Hello World\"") // \" to print out quotation mark 
print("\") // \ prints out a backlash 

#concatenation 
phrase = hello 
print(phrase + "world")

#functions - can be used to modify the string or add to the string 
phrase = hello

print(phrase.upper()) //to convert the string to uppercase

print(phrase.lower()) //to convert the string to lowercase

print(phrase.isupper()) //checks the string if uppercase

print(phrase.islower()) //checks the string if lowercase

print(len(phrase)) //tells how many characters are there in the string

print(phrase[0]) //tells what is the letter or the character based on the index. 
//index starts with 0 so for the sample code it will print the first character in the string

print(phrase.index("h")) //tells what index is the value you inputted 
// for the example it will output 0 as the h is the first character
// if you put multiple characters it will output the starting number 

print(phrase.replace("he", "ya")) // changes the he to ya

-numbers-
print(2) //prints number

+ - addition
* - multiplication
- - subtraction
/ - division 
% - modulus (gives out the remainder)

//use paranthesis for the order of operations ex: print(3*(4+5)) will add 4 and 5 first 
//numbers can be stored in variables 

my_num = 3
print(str(my_num) + "is my favorite number") //to print number along a string you need to use str()

abs() - gives the absolute value 
pow(3,2) - gives 3 raised to the power of 2
max(4,6) - returns the number that is higher
min(4,6) - returns the smallest number
round() - rounds off the number 

#math functions 
from math import * // math module to access more math function 

floor() - always round down the number
ceil() - always round up the number
sqrt() - gives out the sqrt of the number 

-getting input from the user- 
name = input("Enter your name: ") //input() allows the user to have an input 
age = input("Enter your age: ") 
print("Hello " + name + "! You are" + age)

-lists-
fruits = ["apple", "pears", "grapes"]
print(fruits) //prints whole list
print(fruits[]) //prints the element based on the index (index will always start in 0 if you use -1 it will start at the first element on the back of the list)
print(fruits[1:]) //prints the element at index 1 up to the end 
print(fruits[1:3]) //prints the element at index 1 up to before 3

#list function 
fruits = ["apple", "pears", "grapes"]
vegetables = ["cabbage", "carrots", "potato"]
fruits.extend(vegetables) //adds the 2 lists together 
fruits.append("papaya") //add another element to the end of the end of the list 
fruits.insert(1, "papaya") //the element "papaya" will be in the index 1 place and the other elements will be moved
fruits.remove() //removes a specific element for the list
fruits.clear() //clears everything from the list 
fruits.pop() //removes the last element of the list 
fruits.sort() //put list in ascending order (alphabetical or numerical)
fruits.reverse() //put list in reverse order
fruits2 = fruit.copy() //replica of the list 
print(fruits.index("apple")) //prints out the index of the element of the list 
print(fruits.count("apple")) //counts how many time the element appears on the list
